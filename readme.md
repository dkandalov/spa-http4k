Instructions for mob/ensemble:
- **clone** this project
- make sure `./gradlew test` works ok
- compile and run project from IntelliJ IDEA
  (I noticed some random problems in the latest IDE versions configuring project via gradle,
  so just in case, all the libraries are in the `lib` folder and can be manually added to the project)
